### SMTP will not be fixed

The IETF initially disregarded&mdash;and later declined to mitigate&mdash;the vulnerability of SMTP 
to social engineering attacks by cybercriminals, 
even though similar fraud had been practiced by telephone and fax for decades prior to the standardization of email.
The IETF instead committed to the principle that anyone, claiming any identity (i.e. "real name"), 
must be able to email you any content, without limits.
Their justification has long been that "spam" is inevitable but manageable, and therefore a minor irritation.
As a result, email became and will forevermore be a universal cyberattack channel.

A significant number of people have offered proposals to prevent email abuse,
with the intention of working on the issue, only to be dismissed and even mocked.
Indeed, IETF members began circulating the text below in an effort to curtail critique.
The clear (but bizarre) implication is that a protocol that prevents weaponization of electronic correspondence is pointless.

You might be an anti-spam kook if...

Each item in the following list was suggested by the words or actions
of people who presented themselves to the IETF or elsewhere as having discovered the FUSSP.
Some of the items may seem obscure to those who have not dealt with the IETF.

Almost all of those who have inspired this list mean well.
In many cases, they are not in the habit of thinking
critically and believe that "Star Trek" accurately depicts the creation
of hardware, software, and even social or political mechanisms.
