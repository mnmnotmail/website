## Questionnaire re TMTP for Critical B2B Comms

_Questions to pose to businesses that rely on B2B comms. (Draft, 12-Apr-2022)_

Context: I'd like to learn how your firm (_Firm_ below) interacts with customers via email, SMS, and other messaging channels.
I'm building software for messaging via direct links (i.e. without third party intermediaries), 
which is better & cheaper than existing solutions.

What are the types of messages or data transfers by _Firm_ to customers? For example:
- anomalies or incidents, i.e. urgent
- responses to customer support requests
- invoices or payments
- data deliveries, e.g. files, archives
- marketing & sales

For each type:
- What priority is it, and how frequent?
- Is a response by customer possible/expected?
- How much data is transferred?

For each type, what channel & technology (service, protocol, application, data format, etc) is used?
- e.g. email, Slack, Teams, social media, SMS, phone app, website
- Is that tech secure, reliable, fast, engaging, auditable?
- Is that tech vulnerable to social engineering attacks (phishing, attachments)?
- How can that tech fail, and how often does it?
- How satisfactory is that tech to _Firm_, and to customers?

For each type, what improvements would _Firm_ wish to have (in an ideal world)?
- e.g. security, reliability, performance, content design, customer response rate, customer satisfaction
- If you could replace the tech with one designed for that use case, how would you rate your interest 1-10?

For what types of issues do customers initiate interaction via messaging channels?
- e.g. support, purchase order, security incident

For each channel:
- Is that channel en/discouraged, and why?
- Does _Firm_ respond via the same channel?
- How satisfactory is it to _Firm_, and to customers?

What do you wish each channel did differently/better?
- If you could replace it with tech designed for your use cases, how would you rate your interest 1-10?

How many successful phishing (or other social engineering) incidents has _Firm_ handled in past 12 months?
- Which channels did they start on?
- Proportions posing as customers, employees, trusted service providers, random?
- How did _Firm_ notify any affected customers?
- How has _Firm_ adapted to social engineering attacks via messaging channels; has it been effective?
