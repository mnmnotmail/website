### Source of GitHub Pages site

The `w/` directory is sourced entirely from 
[mnm-hammer/web](https://github.com/networkimprov/mnm-hammer/tree/master/web) and 
[webdeps.sh](https://github.com/networkimprov/mnm-hammer/blob/master/webdeps.sh).

To obtain the files `w/*-demo.*` see directions at 
[mnm-hammer demo files](https://github.com/networkimprov/mnm-hammer#demo-files).

_Todo: post zipped `store/` directory for demo accounts (Chox HQ, etc)._
