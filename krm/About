<h3>For Creators</h3>

Today's social media is terrible for creators 
and those who wish to promote their work or reuse it with permission.
For example, they...

<ul>
<li>Drown out the work of compassionate, skilled creators by letting anyone post virtually anything.</li>
<li>Rely on secret, ever-shifting algorithms to select content for users.</li>
<li>Distract your audience from absorbing the full length of each work they open.</li>
<li>Yank or demonetize works and whole accounts without warnings or stated reasons.</li>
<li>Deny creators fair payment for their work.</li>
<li>Exclude expert curators who feature others' works on their own channels.</li>
<li>Provide no way to order works so that users always receive them in a specific sequence.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today's social media corporations don't care if creators or audiences suffer at their hands, 
as quarterly profit growth is all that matters in their mindset.
But the above issues are unnecessary, and that mindset is unsustainable, 
so we're building a new media model for creators whose work cultivates 
awareness, understanding, cohesion, wellness.
</p>

<h3>Creator roles: Author &amp; Curator</h3>

<p>Authors publish their own works. Today, most creators fit in this category.
</p>

<p>Curators re-publish Authors' works that are tagged for re-use.
Curators may also edit an Author's work (provided they preserve the Author's intent), 
by taking segments and perhaps refining them or inserting commentary.
The result is then publishable by that Curator and the Author whose work it borrows.
</p>

<p>Authors can also act as Curators, and vice versa.<br/>
Note: the Listener UI refers to all creators as "DJs".
</p>

<h3>Creator tools</h3>

(See the <em>Curate</em> screen.)

<p><em>Home:</em> your DJ profile, and list of Programs.
You create a Program with the &#xff0b; dropdown at top-right of <em>Curate</em>.
</p>

<p><em>Library:</em> your clips repository 
(includes uploaded and third-party clips &amp; albums).
To create an album, upload a group of clips released by the same Author on the same date.
A clip can appear in multiple Programs.
</p>

<p><em>Program:</em> a named sequence of related clips 
(e.g. segments from the same podcast, clips focused on a topic).
When added to a Program, a clip is unpublished, and may be posted or removed.
When posted to a Program, a clip may be hidden.
</p>

<p>Circles let their members share clips within a private, invitation-only group.
A Circle allows a creator to preview works to a small, known audience 
prior to publishing in a Program.
(See the <em>For Listeners</em> section for more on Circles.)
</p>

<p>We screen creators (both Authors &amp; Curators) for alignment with our mission 
before allowing them to post or re-publish content for public consumption.
However any member of a Circle can post in that Circle without a screening approval.
</p>

<p>Finally, our software is open source, so if creators wish to establish alternative sites, 
they're free to do so.

<h3>For Listeners</h3>

Today's social media has terrible problems that are widely recognized.
For example, they...

<ul>
<li>Promote whatever causes "engagement", even outraging, alarming, depressing, or false material.</li>
<li>Bury content you want/need with opaque recommendation algorithms.</li>
<li>Want everyone to post material, chase followers, and comment on others' work.</li>
<li>Glue your eyes to a screen, pulling you out of the real world.</li>
<li>Create a cycle of dissatisfaction/depression followed by use in hopes of feeling better.</li>
<li>Foster a twisted, bleak view of one's self, community, and world.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today's social media corporations don't care if their members or society suffer at their hands, 
as quarterly profit growth is all that matters in their mindset.
But these problems are solvable, and that mindset is unsustainable, 
so we're building a new media model that brings audiences 
awareness, understanding, cohesion, wellness.
</p>

<p>We're centered around short-form audio (e.g. 1-6 minute clips), 
from "DJs" who produce original work and/or edit and organize others' works 
into cohesive programs.
The content is primarily spoken-word (conversations &amp; monologues), 
and instrumental music (e.g. jazz, classical, soundscapes).
We screen all creators for alignment with our mission before allowing them 
to contribute works for public hearing.
Very few topics are out-of-bounds; 
what we care about is a compassionate, constructive tone conveying each perspective.
</p>
