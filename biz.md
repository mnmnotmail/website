## Business Case

_A venture pitch based on the mnm project. (Draft, 29-Dec-2021)_

### Market

1 billion worldwide knowledge workers, especially those who use email daily. 
Initially, English & Spanish speakers.

Email use is limited in some developing countries (e.g. Indonesia) where instant messaging apps are more common, 
but these share many of the problems below.

Early target verticals: those most at risk of cyberattack (TBD)

### Problem

Knowledge workers are on the front line of an undeclared cyberwar, 
carried out by global organized crime groups against businesses. 
The spoils are money (ransoms) and confidential data. 
Businesses are losing this war, and their losses are increasing. 
Loss estimates were ~$1 trillion in 2020 alone.

The most effective way to initiate cyberattacks is via phishing or other "social engineering" techniques, 
delivered via email and other services which allow anyone on the Internet to contact you.

Email was designed for an Internet whose population was tiny, and composed of academics and engineers. 
The possibility that email might be used by over a billion people never occurred to them. 
Email was intended for a specific community, not the global community. 
It cannot be adapted for today's crime-infested Internet.

Second problem: Electronic correspondence is central to knowledge work, 
but the email user experience has been stagnant for a long time, 
and doesn't support common forms of communication, e.g.
- sending a form/survey that the recipient can fill out and return *
- including a chart/graph which is drawn from an attached dataset
- formatting a message as a deck of slides or tabs *
- referencing a different discussion thread or message with a hyperlink *
- adding a new recipient to a long-running, multi-party thread *
- dropping out of a thread that's no longer of interest
- notifying contacts of online presence and out-of-office status *
- discussing & progressively revising a document (or set of docs)
- issuing task requests with a due-date, owner, subtasks, etc
- compiling a collection of related threads, tasks, documents, URLs, and wiki pages
- making payments between contacts, and micro-payments to a site host

(__*__ = Wholly or partly implemented in mnm v0.9)

### Solution

A decentralized network (via an open protocol) for knowledge work, centered on teams & organizations & associations. 
Sites in the network are members-only, and allow communications only between members of that site. 
Every knowledge worker will belong to many sites (just as they belong to many real-world communities today). 
Most sites will verify the identity of their members, especially those sites which carry confidential communications.

A single client app manages all your sites, but traffic originating at different sites is not intermixed. 
(This is illustrated in the demo.) 
This client also advances the electronic correspondence UX in fundamental ways.

It's hard to change people's work habits. 
Offering knowledge workers a tool that prevents attacks but merely works like email probably can't succeed. 
However, the widespread adoption of alternative messaging and discussion apps (used alongside email) 
demonstrates that people will adopt new tools that empower them in new ways.

(Paul Graham, among many others, has called for [a better email protocol](http://www.paulgraham.com/ambitious.html){:target="_blank"}.)

### Competition

Available email alternatives don't bestow key benefits of email.

All workplaces have office politics. 
Web-based intranet discussion boards make written communications visible across the company/dept/team. 
Office politics requires that people be able to communicate privately, person-to-person(s), 
and defer delivery of content to corporate repositories until it has buy-in from concerned stakeholders. 
This is possible with messaging apps, however...

Instant messaging apps (Slack/etc) don't foster reflection & composition, but promote distraction and pointless chatter. 
They only cover a fraction of the use cases of email.

Virtually all of the dozens of offerings are closed systems owned/operated by a single vendor, 
meaning you can't use third party applications with them, or create a custom application. 
Only one of these solutions is based on an open network protocol 
(Matrix), which is complex and oriented towards real-time comms, e.g. chat and video calls.

There's plenty of competition, but all of them have misunderstood the problem. 
None of them has a dominant market position.
